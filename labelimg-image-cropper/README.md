# LabelImg Image Cropper

This PowerShell script is designed to crop images labeled using [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) annotation tool. It processes XML files generated by LabelImg, extracts object annotations, and crops the corresponding JPEG images accordingly. The cropped images are then organized into subdirectories under the "out" folder, with each subdirectory named after the object type.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): FFmpeg is used for image cropping.

## Usage

1. Download this PowerShell script to your local machine.

2. Place your XML files (generated by LabelImg) and their corresponding JPEG images in the same directory.

3. Open a PowerShell terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```powershell
   .\labelimg-image-cropper.ps1

## Output

The script will generate cropped images and organize them in the "out" directory. Each subdirectory under "out" corresponds to an object type as labeled in LabelImg and contains the cropped images.
